KPI's Table

| KPI's                | Name           | Symbol |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| Sum of Sales         | Total Sales    | üìà     |
| Sum of Profit        | Total Profit   | üí∞     |
| Sum of Quantity      | Total Quantity | üì¶     |
| Count of Order ID    | No of orders   | üõí     |
| Sum of Profit Margin | Profit Margin  | üîç     |

But your KPI Card Values show this:
| Total Sales  | Total Profit | Total Quantity | No of Orders | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ‚Çπ 12,642,502 | ‚Çπ 1,467,457  | 178,312        | 51,290       | 11.61%        |

Problem Description:

1- Profit Margin Calculation Issue:
Your KPI table suggests "Sum of Profit Margin" ‚Äî which is incorrect, because profit margin should not be summed.
Profit Margin = (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100
In the final KPI card, the correct calculated 11.61% is shown ‚Äî but your KPI table says "Sum of Profit Margin", which is misleading.

2- Incorrect KPI Description:
Count of Order ID is correct as it counts orders.
But for Profit Margin, you should write:
"Calculated Profit Margin = (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100" instead of "Sum of Profit Margin".

Solution Description:

This value shows the business‚Äôs overall ability to generate income by selling products to its customers.

Description:
Total Profit indicates how much money the company has earned after covering all costs associated with the products sold. It reflects the business's efficiency in managing costs and pricing products. A positive profit shows that the company is running successfully, whereas negative profit would indicate potential issues in pricing, costs, or sales.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total Quantity Sold (178,312 Units)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Number of Orders (51,290 Orders)
Description:
This value reflects the total number of individual purchase orders placed by customers. It is a useful indicator to measure order volume, customer activity, and engagement level. More orders typically imply greater customer reach and market penetration.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Profit Margin (11.61%)
Description:
Profit Margin shows the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all costs are deducted. It is a critical measure of how efficiently the company converts sales into actual profit.
