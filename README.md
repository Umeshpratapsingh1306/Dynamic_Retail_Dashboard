KPI's Table

| KPI's                | Name           | Symbol |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| Sum of Sales         | Total Sales    | üìà     |
| Sum of Profit        | Total Profit   | üí∞     |
| Sum of Quantity      | Total Quantity | üì¶     |
| Count of Order ID    | No of orders   | üõí     |
| Sum of Profit Margin | Profit Margin  | üîç     |

But your KPI Card Values show this:
| Total Sales  | Total Profit | Total Quantity | No of Orders | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| ‚Çπ 12,642,502 | ‚Çπ 1,467,457  | 178,312        | 51,290       | 11.61%        |

Problem Description:

1- Profit Margin Calculation Issue:
Your KPI table suggests "Sum of Profit Margin" ‚Äî which is incorrect, because profit margin should not be summed.
Profit Margin = (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100
In the final KPI card, the correct calculated 11.61% is shown ‚Äî but your KPI table says "Sum of Profit Margin", which is misleading.

2- Incorrect KPI Description:
Count of Order ID is correct as it counts orders.
But for Profit Margin, you should write:
"Calculated Profit Margin = (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100" instead of "Sum of Profit Margin".
